Hello Miriam, Ramadhan Kareem ðŸŒ™ ... 

Let me first introduce myself. My name is Mohamed Dridi, and I'm an organizer with the GDG (Google Developer Group)

We're organizing 'Ramatch'  a series of online tech workshops covering AI, web, cloud, and more. and would love to collaborate with you on a workshop covering AI and project management.

 Given your PMP certification and experience hosting AI talks with GDG, we believe your expertise would be invaluable.
